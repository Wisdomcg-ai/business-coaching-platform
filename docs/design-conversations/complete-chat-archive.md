## 📅 Daily Progress Log

### Day 1: Foundation Setup
**Time: ~1 hour**

**Completed:**
✅ GitHub repository: `business-coaching-platform`  
✅ Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS  
✅ Supabase project: `coaching-platform-prod`  
✅ Environment variables configured  
✅ Cross-computer development workflow established  
✅ Development server tested and working  

**Key Learnings:**
- Initial Next.js startup can take 10+ minutes first time
- File conflicts between GitHub and Next.js setup are common
- Terminal navigation and basic git commands essential
- Environment variable security critical

**Technical Decisions:**
- Chose Next.js 14 App Router over Pages Router
- Supabase over other backend solutions for rapid development
- TypeScript for better code quality and AI assistance
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development

### Day 2: Database Schema & User Management
**Time: ~45 minutes**

**Completed:**
✅ Core database tables designed and created  
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented  
✅ TypeScript types auto-generated  
✅ Database connection tested successfully  

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Core Tables Created:
- profiles (user management)
- businesses (client organizations) 
- business_members (team relationships)
- assessments (diagnostic data)
- strategic_wheels (6-component planning)
- success_disciplines (12 disciplines)
- goals_90_day (quarterly goals)
- daily_check_ins (daily accountability)
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Database design should match business methodology exactly
- RLS policies essential for multi-tenant security
- Auto-generated TypeScript types save significant time
- Simple test pages invaluable for debugging

### Day 3: Authentication & Dashboards  
**Time: ~1 hour**

**Completed:**
✅ User registration/login system  
✅ Secure session management  
✅ Professional dashboard with methodology workflow  
✅ Proper routing and redirects  
✅ Role-based access foundation  

**Authentication Flow:**
```
Home (/) → Login (/auth/login) → Dashboard (/dashboard)
With proper logout and session management
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Email confirmation required for Supabase auth by default
- Dashboard should reflect coaching methodology progression
- User experience matters from day one
- Authentication debugging requires browser dev tools

### Day 4: Assessment System
**Time: ~2 hours**

**Completed:**
✅ Multi-step assessment form (4 phases)  
✅ Revenue stage selection  
✅ 6 Engine Rooms scoring (sliders)  
✅ Strategic Wheel evaluation (dropdowns)  
✅ Success Disciplines assessment (12 items)  
✅ Automatic scoring calculations  
✅ Database storage with debugging  
✅ Professional results page  

**Technical Challenges Resolved:**
- Missing `completed_by` column in assessments table
- Missing `completion_percentage` column
- RLS policy configuration for inserts
- Development server stability issues

## 🔧 Technical Setup Guide

### Development Environment
```bash
# Essential tools needed:
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- Browser with dev tools
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal/command line access

# Key commands:
npm run dev          # Start development server
git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push  # Save progress
open [file]          # Open files on Mac
mkdir -p [path]      # Create nested folders
```

### Cross-Computer Workflow
1. **GitHub repository** stores all code
2. **Supabase project** manages database
3. **Environment variables** in `.env.local` (never commit)
4. **Daily git commits** to save progress

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. **One step at a time** - break complex tasks into simple steps
2. **Test frequently** - verify each component before moving on
3. **Save progress daily** - commit working code regularly
4. **Debug systematically** - use browser console and error logs
5. **Documentation matters** - save decisions and learnings

### Beginner-Friendly Approach
- **Exact commands** with expected outputs
- **Step-by-step verification** at each stage
- **Clear error resolution** with specific fixes
- **Plain language explanations** avoiding technical jargon
- **Multiple options** when one approach doesn't work

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Supabase over custom backend** - faster development, built-in auth
- **Next.js App Router** - modern React patterns, better performance
- **TypeScript** - better AI assistance, fewer runtime errors
- **Tailwind CSS** - rapid styling, consistent design system
- **Row Level Security** - proper multi-tenant data isolation

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Server Won't Start:**
```bash
# Try these in order:
1. Ctrl+C to stop
2. npm run dev to restart
3. Close terminal completely and reopen
4. cd Desktop/business-coaching-platform
5. npm install (if dependencies changed)
6. npm run dev
```

**Database Errors:**
```sql
-- Check table structure in Supabase
-- Add missing columns:
ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [column] [type];

-- Fix RLS policies:
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON [table] 
FOR [operation] USING (condition);
```

**Authentication Issues:**
- Check Supabase Auth settings
- Verify environment variables in `.env.local`
- Confirm email verification settings
- Use browser dev tools console for errors

**File/Folder Errors:**
```bash
# Create missing directories:
mkdir -p src/app/[path]
