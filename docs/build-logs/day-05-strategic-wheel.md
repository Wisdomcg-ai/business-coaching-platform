# Day 5: Strategic Wheel Module

## Completed ✅
- Strategic Wheel visualization with correct colors and layout
- Navigation structure between wheel and section pages
- Section pages exist at:
  - /strategic-wheel/vision-purpose
  - /strategic-wheel/strategy-market
  - /strategic-wheel/people-culture
  - /strategic-wheel/systems-execution
  - /strategic-wheel/money-metrics
  - /strategic-wheel/communications-alignment

## Issues to Fix 🔧
1. Navigation breaks at strategy-market (returns to dashboard)
2. Fields are not required/validated
3. No save functionality to database
4. Colors are rainbow-like, need consistent design
5. Need to link answers to diagnostic assessment

## Next Steps 📝
- Fix navigation flow between all sections
- Add form validation (all fields required)
- Implement save/resume functionality
- Apply consistent color scheme
- Connect to diagnostic data
- Add progress tracking
